## Key Conventions

### Routing
- Localised routes use `/{locale}/path` prefix for non-English languages
- English (default) has no prefix: `/country/germany`
- Route registration uses a `$registerRoutes` closure applied to both locale-prefixed and root groups
- Language switch: `GET /lang/{locale}`

### Translations
- 24 EU languages supported (all official EU languages)
- Default: English (`en`)
- Translation chain: Cache → Database → DeepL API → Fallback to English
- Language files in `lang/{locale}/ui.php`
- Config: `config/translation.php`
- Languages without DeepL: `ga` (Irish), `hr` (Croatian), `mt` (Maltese)

### SEO indexing
- Every supported language is indexable by default (`config/seo.php`); `SEO_INDEXABLE_LOCALES=en,de` limits it. Translated pages are self-canonical and carry hreflang for every indexable language.
- Pages whose body text is English in every language are listed in `SeoPolicy::ENGLISH_BODY_ROUTES`. Their translated URLs canonicalize to the English page, carry no hreflang and appear in the XML sitemap only in English. Remove a route from the list once its page is translated; `tests/Feature/SeoBodyLanguageTest.php` checks the sitemap against the list.
- Shared calculations are indexable only when `CalculationIndexing::isTopCalculation()` accepts them: a top amount (`TopCalculations::AMOUNTS`) at an EU member's standard rate, in either direction, which are exactly the links on the top calculations pages. Every other value is `noindex, follow` and canonicalizes to the country's calculator. Non-canonical segments (`1000.00`, `19.0`) redirect with a 301 (`CanonicalizeSharedCalculation`).

### Frontend
- **Read `DESIGN.md` before any UI change.** It is the design system and styleguide (tokens, brand surfaces, component recipes, patterns, accessibility rules). `tests/Feature/DesignSystemTest.php` enforces it, and `.claude/skills/design-system` loads it for Claude Code.
- `/styleguide` renders the design system with live examples from `resources/views/styleguide/examples`; `/styleguide/design.tokens.json` (Design Tokens Community Group JSON) and `/styleguide.md` are generated from `resources/css/app.css` and `DESIGN.md` by `App\Support\DesignSystem`, so they never need editing by hand. `tests/Feature/StyleguideTest.php` keeps them in step
- Interactive UI uses **Livewire 4** components with **Alpine.js** (`resources/js/app.js`) for instant client-side feedback — no SPA framework
- Styling: **Tailwind CSS 4** with semantic OKLCH tokens and `app-*` component classes in `resources/css/app.css`; no component library
- Look: solid and institutional — flat EU navy (`brand`) for header, heroes and footer, EU gold only as a thin accent on navy, opaque white surfaces with hairline borders; no glass, blur or decorative gradients
- Shape: `rounded-control` (4px), `rounded-card` (6px), `rounded-panel` (8px); no pill buttons, chips or badges (`rounded-full` is for dots and spinners)
- Dark mode: class-based (`.dark` on `<html>`), driven by the tokens — do not add `dark:` variants, raw palette colours, literal colours or default `shadow-*` utilities
- Icons: `<x-ui.icon name="…">` (inline Lucide paths); flags: `<x-ui.flag :iso="…">` (local SVGs); pagination: return `'pagination.livewire'` from `paginationView()`
- VAT maths: `App\Support\Vat` (PHP) mirrored by `resources/js/vat.js`; keep both in sync
- Structured data: `<x-json-ld :data="[…]">` (never write `@context` in Blade)

### Site archive (`/v1`)
- `public/v1/` is a frozen, static English snapshot of the site as it was before the 5.0 redesign (`main` at `d1670fc`, captured on 29 September 2026). The web server serves its 246 pages directly as `…/index.html`; no Laravel route is involved, so never add a `v1` route.
- Each page is `noindex, nofollow`, shows the archive bar (`public/v1/archive.css`) and loads `public/v1/archive.js`, which answers the old Livewire 3 runtime in the browser: calculations work, picking a calculator country opens that country's archived page, and server actions (VIES checks, filters, sign-ups) show a read-only notice instead of calling a server.
- Links to pages that were not archived (other languages, shared calculations, the API) point to the live site. The footer ("Previous version") and the changelog link to `/v1/`.
- It sits outside the design system: do not edit, restyle or reformat it. `tests/Feature/SiteArchiveTest.php` guards that it stays complete, unindexed, self-contained and free of server calls.

### MCP server
- `App\Support\Mcp\VatMcpServer` defines the public MCP server once: name, protocol versions, instructions, rate limits and every tool with its schema and annotations. `Api\McpController` serves it at `POST /api/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, stateless JSON, `throttle:mcp`).
- The MCP server card, the OAuth protected-resource metadata, `llms.txt` and the `/mcp-server` page all read from it, so a new tool needs three changes only: its definition in `VatMcpServer::tools()`, its handler in `McpController`, and its page copy under `ui.mcp_page.tools` in all 24 locales. `tests/Feature/McpServerTest.php` checks that they stay in step.

### Testing
- Framework: **Pest 4** (preferred) with PHPUnit 12 underneath
- Test location: `tests/Feature/` and `tests/Unit/`
- Run tests: `php artisan test` or `./vendor/bin/pest`
- Lint: `./vendor/bin/pint` (Laravel Pint)

### Admin Panel
- **Filament 5** at `/admin`
- Resources: Country, CountryAnalytic, Banner
- Widgets: Dashboard stats, charts
- Auditing: `owen-it/laravel-auditing` on Country model

### Adding a New Feature

**New Livewire page:**
1. Create component: `php artisan make:livewire PageName`
2. Add route in `routes/web.php` inside the `$registerRoutes` closure (so it works for all locales)
3. Create Blade view in `resources/views/livewire/`
4. Add translations to all 24 `lang/{locale}/ui.php` files (or use TranslationService)

**New country tab:**
1. Add tab slug to the `where('tab', '...')` regex in `routes/web.php`
2. Add tab component/partial in the `CountryPage` Livewire component
3. Update sitemap generator to include new tab URLs

**New API endpoint:**
1. Add route to `routes/api.php`
2. Create controller in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/`
3. Create API resource in `app/Http/Resources/`

**New translation key:**
1. Add to `lang/en/ui.php`
2. Run translation job or manually add to all 24 locales
3. Use `__('ui.key_name')` in Blade templates

### Deployment
- Hosted on **Laravel Forge** (auto-deploy on push to `main`)
- Build: Vite compiles assets during deploy
- Queue worker managed by Forge/Supervisor
